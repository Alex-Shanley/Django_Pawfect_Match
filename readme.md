# 🐾 Pawfect

**Pawfect** When I first read the brief and saw that it had a database focus, I wanted to challenge myself to think differently. Rather than taking a typical approach, I decided to step outside my comfort zone and explore a more creative direction. I began ideating ways to bring all my skills together into one cohesive project, which led me to the concept of building an admin-style portal.

I chose to develop Pawfect Match, a playful and engaging platform centred around pet adoption. As an animal lover, I wanted to create something that not only showcased my technical abilities, such as integrating SQL templates, flash submission forms, and pet management features like "Add Pet" and "Edit Pet" pages, but also carried a meaningful purpose.

The idea of pets without homes is something that deeply resonates with me, so I intentionally designed the platform to be cheerful and uplifting. By creating a vibrant and user-friendly experience, I aimed to bring positivity and joy to a serious topic, making Pawfect Match both functional and emotionally engaging.
